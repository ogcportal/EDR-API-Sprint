# Environmental Data Retrieval API Sprint

This repository was used to house issues and artifacts related to a sprint planned for March 18th through 20th at the NWS in Silverspring, Maryland, USA. Due to the ongoing situation with COVID-19, the sprint was not an in-person event and all activities were conducted through this repository, shared documents, and telecommunications. 

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/opengeospatial/EDR-API-Sprint/wiki) for the agenda and links to general sprint resources such as gotomeeting links and shared documents.

Please use [issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/EDR-API-Sprint/issues) for any "for the record" content and be conscious of keeping the issues well-structured and on-point.
