# Environmental Data Retrieval API Sprint

This repository was used to house issues and artifacts related to a sprint planned for 18th through 20th March 2020 at the US National Weather Service in Silverspring, Maryland, USA. Because of the situation with COVID-19, the sprint was not an in-person event and all activities were conducted through this repository, shared documents, and telecommunications. 

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/opengeospatial/EDR-API-Sprint/wiki) for the agenda and links to general sprint resources such as GoToMeeting links and shared documents.

Please use [issues](https://github.com/opengeospatial/EDR-API-Sprint/issues) for any "for the record" content and be conscious of keeping the issues well-structured and on-point.

There is a final [Engineering Report of the Sprint](https://github.com/opengeospatial/EDR-API-Sprint/blob/master/EDR-API-Sprint-ER/20-032.pdf) as a PDF but also as a [Markdown Document](https://github.com/opengeospatial/EDR-API-Sprint/blob/master/Final_Report_0of_EDR_API_Sprint.md).
