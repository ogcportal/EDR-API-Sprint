== Recommendations and Next Steps

* WKT LineString format to be used for multi-dimensional geometries

* Some query names were changed (Polygon -> Area, Point -> Position)

* The specification will not mention streaming, because it is an implementation detail

* Agreed that we would allow named "locations" (now Positions)

* Agreed that named “times” seem to be a good analogy to named “locations,” such as “Latest”

* Groups vs Collections were explored and the current working definition of Collections remains

=== Recommended Topics for further discussion

* Contribute EDR API definition of a Collection to the wider OGC debate

* Decide what Metadata frameworks should be used, recommended or mandated and expand metadata offerings

* Determine workflows and search metadata to integrate with OGC API - Records

* Security considerations. This needs to be coordinated with other OGC API groups and the Security Domain Working Group

* Test other sampling geometry types.

* Continue to investigate how to integrate with other APIs (features/coordinates, maps)

* Incorporate a pub/sub mechanism with a later version of the EDR API specification

* Investigate how to align with decision impact groups like SmartCity, others

=== Next Steps for EDR API Specification

* Generate Engineering Report on Sprint

* Finalize updates to current specification

* Update documentation

* Start wider consultation processes inside and outside OGC
